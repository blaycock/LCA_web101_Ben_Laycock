            <p>I have hit my first “fork-in-the-road” as I continue my journey to be a developer. Right now, at this very second in time (February, 13th 2019 at 3:15 pm CST) I am able to grasp CSS better than HTML. Does this even make sense? Do other students, who jump out of a plane into the coding world go through this “phase”? Or, am I the only one? I am struggling with the organization part of HTML. I manage million dollar projects for a local Credit Union! Organizing is a part of everything that I do. But, the funny thing about being un-organized and a noob to the coding world is that I am having a blast. Being able to hit a snag, research and learn is like exploring a newly undiscovered territory. THIS IS FUN!

            <p>It is hard to believe that this is only week two of Lubbock Coding Academy’s first group of students ever, but I am learning a progressing through each assignment and enjoying every minute. The best part of our last session was visually drawing out what is going to be created. This technique know as wireframing, brings to light the central goal and helps keep the focus on the task at hand. Coding from scratch is like going down a rabbit hole and never returning. Being able to map out and include the HTML tags on the wireframe helps with my struggle to stay (HTML) organized. The best part about a wireframe is that it doesn’t have to be an artist or designer. Wireframes are very basic and to the point. It reminds me of the maps that a child draws at a young age to find the buried treasure. This concept can cross over and can be used in any industry. It creates direction, organization, and vision.</p>
                    
            <p>Since CSS is fresh on my mind, I want to cover a way to visually hide content and only make it available for screen readers. For information on screen readers, please check out my previous blog here. One way to hide content and only make it accessible for screen readers is to first create a class in HTML called “hidden”. After creating the class, reference it in CSS (example: .hidden) then create the positioning, height, width, etc. This will allow sighted users to NOT see the hidden content visually and properly convey the message to the end users that are using a screen reader. There are other ways to accomplish this task. After some research, this was the easiest route that I found.</p>
                    
            <p>The last topic that I want to share in regards to CSS is a term called BFC or Block Formatting Context. According to MDN web docs, A block formatting context is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a Web page. It is the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements. These are very important and center around the positioning and clearing of “floats”. The rules apply only to the things in the same block formatting and do not affect other blocks in regards to formatting. So much learned and so much more to learn. Next up for me… a simple google on “how to better organize HTML”.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">It Git(s) Better</h2>
            <p>Another day of class, another truck ride confessional… “How in the world am I going to be able to keep up with all of the website changes that I am making in Visual Studio Code”? As I was leaving from work to go to my second coding class, this question drowned out the sound of music playing from my tuck’s radio. “Should I create a spreadsheet to help keep track of every version and/or update that I make to my website”? “Maybe I can come up with a cool naming convention like Android’s software does with candy”. The answer was actually very simple: git.</p>

            <p>Having our class instructor Jeffery draw out how GitHub works reminded me of Lion King. Why, you ask? The circle of life! Now I know that GitHub doesn’t involve life and death, but seeing how to clone, pull, commit, push in one continuous loop sparked the resemblance for me. The ability to have an open-source version control tool is essential to building a website. Instead of creating version one to a million and risk losing what was created, GitHub was the answer that I needed. The ability to clone everything back to my local machine, work on the file structure, make changes, delete files, commit all of the changes and push everything to update the queen-bee version in GitHub has been one of the best learning experiences thus far. Another great experience has come from setting up my website. Knowing the proper workflow of starting with the index.html and style.css files is the key to starting a website. Building in various components like a blog using a separate file containing its own .html and style.css to reference in a website starts to develop the organization and workflow of a website. When working on the blueprint of a website ARIA is needed to make sure the website is more accessible to people with disabilities. This helps programs like screen readers guide users with disabilities through a website seamlessly and creates a better user experience. through ARIA enhancements and the use of screen readers, users are verbally navigated through the website as if the website had a tour guide.</p>

            <h2 class="content-title">Why Learn to Code?</h2>
            <p>While driving to class for the first session I asked myself this very question, “why learn to code” when you are 10 years into your career? Not just a career, but one that you have enjoyed for over the past decade and one that excites you! The answer is simple… growth. Opportunity to learn a new skill and grow as a Project Director and Applications Manager is hard to pass up. I was excited to see LEDA and the City of Lubbock create a boot camp and curriculum centered around web development and coding. I actually was an intern for LEDA during my college years and was thrilled to reach out to them about this opportunity.</p>

            <p>Day one of class went by very fast and I knew from the moment that my first hero banner was rolled out for viewing (it was really bad) I made the right decision. Learning to navigate VS Code, add extensions, creating various shortcuts was the best part of day one. Seeing every student and hearing the excitement in their voices was icing on the cake. One last thing that I took away from the first class was the S.P.L.A.T. Knowing that you have a community to learn from, help out, and grow with is comforting and motivational. Being able to actually peel back the layers and understand how websites are made is cool. Breaking, fixing, breaking again, fixing again triggers my inner-kid and I think that is why coding interests me so much. I graduated from Texas Tech with a Marketing degree and jumping into CSS made that part of my life re-appear. Putting the “pretty-ness” to a webpage and diving into stock photography so that I can bring to life the HTML made me feel creative. Learning the basics like, doctype being the instructor to a web browser about what version of markup language the page is written, was a great start to the beginning of a new chapter in my career. One thing I didn’t know was how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector. After some research, the answer is pretty simple. They (CSS selectors) read it from right to left.</p>
